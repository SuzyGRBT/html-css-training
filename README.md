# html-css-training
This particular page was made with the help of free Figma design. Source (https://www.figma.com/file/kwBzqEEHiD4EOuNRYlDwVi/File?node-id=711%3A11). The main and only purpose is training and studying the concept of SASS. I do not claim the rights to the design.

I have made several chages to the existing design so that it would look nicer in web-version.

The web version is available on https://suzygrbt.github.io/html-css-training/
